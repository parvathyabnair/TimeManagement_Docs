## Notifications
The **Notifications** section controls how and when the application alerts you, keeping you informed about important updates across your workflow.

### Viewing and Interacting with Notifications
Once enabled, you can stay up-to-date with your work through multiple notification channels:

* **In-App Dashboard:** Tap the **Bell icon (🔔)** located in the top header of the dashboard. This opens a dedicated Notifications panel where you can review recent alerts, see timestamps (e.g., "4m ago"), switch to a "Sync" tab, or use the **Clear All** button to dismiss them.
* **Device Notification Drawer:** Alerts will automatically appear in your phone's standard notification drawer.
* **Lock Screen & Banners:** You will continue to receive notifications even when your phone is locked. When using the device, alerts may also appear as banner notifications above the phone drawer for immediate visibility.
* **Quick Navigation:** Tapping on any notification from your phone's drawer or lock screen will seamlessly open the app and take you directly to the corresponding page to view the details.
* **Notification Types:** The system will alert you to various events, including:
    * **Project updates**
    * **Activity notifications**

### Push Notifications
Allows you to control whether the application can send alerts directly to your device.

**Key Option:**
* **Enable Notifications (Toggle Switch)**
    * **ON**: The app will send real-time notifications for updates such as task changes, project updates, and activity logs.
    * **OFF**: All push notifications will be disabled.

**When to Enable:** If you want to stay informed about updates instantly, or if you rely on reminders for task/project updates and activities.
**When to Disable:** If you prefer fewer interruptions or if you only check updates manually within the app.

### Notification Schedule
Allows you to control *when* notifications are delivered, ensuring they only arrive during your preferred working hours. This is especially useful for maintaining work-life balance and avoiding notifications outside office hours.

**Enable Schedule:**
* **ON**: Notifications will only be sent during configured days and hours.
* **OFF**: Notifications can be sent at any time.

**Timezone:**
* Select your **Timezone** to ensure notifications are aligned with your local time. The default value is usually set to **System Default**.

**Working Days:**
* Options include Monday through Sunday.
* Only selected days will allow notifications, while unselected days will block all notifications.

**Working Hours:**
* **From**: Start time (e.g., 09:00).
* **To**: End time (e.g., 18:00).
* Notifications will only be sent within the selected time range.

**Example Configuration (Standard Work Schedule):**
* Enable Notifications: ON
* Enable Schedule: ON
* Working Days: Monday to Friday
* Working Hours: 09:00 to 18:00
* *Result:* You will only receive notifications during office hours on weekdays.

## Background Sync
The **Background Sync** feature ensures your data stays updated automatically.

**Features:**
* Enable automatic synchronization.
* Set sync frequency.
* Sync tasks, timesheets, projects, project updates, etc., in the background.

**Benefits:** Reduces manual effort, keeps data consistent across devices and accounts, and ensures real-time updates.

### Background Sync Settings Overview
This screen allows you to configure how and when your data is synchronized with the server. This feature works in the background without requiring manual intervention.

**Key Configuration Options:**
1. **Enable AutoSync (Toggle Switch)**
    * **ON**: Automatic synchronization is enabled, and the app will sync data at defined intervals.
    * **OFF**: Background sync is disabled, and data must be synced manually.
2. **Sync Interval**
    * Defines how often the application performs automatic synchronization.
    * Example Options: 5 minutes, 15 minutes, 30 minutes or more.
    * Recommendation: Use **5–15 minutes** for active users; use longer intervals to conserve battery and data usage.
3. **Sync Direction**
    * **Both (Up & Down)** *(Default)*: Uploads local changes to the server and downloads updates from the server.
    * **Upload Only (Up)**: Sends local data to the server but does not fetch updates.
    * **Download Only (Down)**: Retrieves updates from the server but does not upload local changes.
4. **Restart Background Daemon**
    * Allows you to restart the background synchronization service. Use this if sync appears stuck, after changing sync settings, or after reconnecting an account.

### How Background Sync Works
When AutoSync is enabled:
1. The app runs a background service.
2. At each interval, it connects to the configured account/server, uploads new or modified data (tasks, timesheets, etc.), and downloads updates from the server.
3. Updates are applied automatically without user action.

**Best Practices:**
* Keep AutoSync enabled for a seamless experience.
* Use a 15-minute interval for balanced performance and battery usage.
* Keep Sync Direction = Both unless you have a specific need.
* Restart the daemon if syncing issues occur.

## Theme Settings
The **Theme Settings** section allows users to customize the visual appearance of the application.

**Benefits:** Improves readability, enhances user comfort during extended usage, and supports accessibility preferences.

### Available Theme Options
1. **Light Theme**: Bright and clean interface that uses light backgrounds with dark text. Suitable for well-lit environments and daytime use.
2. **Dark Theme**: Dark background with lighter text. Reduces screen brightness and glare.

### How to Change the Theme
1. Select **Theme Settings**.
2. Choose one of the available options: Light Theme or Dark Theme.
3. The selected theme will be applied immediately.

**System Behavior:**
* The currently selected theme is marked with a **check indicator (✔)**.
* Only one theme can be active at a time[cite: 2].
* Theme changes are applied **instantly** across all screens (no restart or refresh is required)[cite: 2].
* The selected theme is **saved automatically** and persists across sessions[cite: 2].

## Voice Model (Beta)
The **Voice Model (Beta)** settings allow you to dictate text directly into the app using your device’s microphone. Because processing happens locally on your device, your voice data remains completely private and no internet connection is required after the initial model download.

Once configured, the voice input icon will be available in the description fields of tasks, timesheets, activities, and project updates. 

### Getting Started
* Make sure you have enabled the **"Enable Voice Input"** toggle under the Voice Model (Beta) settings screen.

### Voice Feature Stages
When dictating in a description field:
* When you click the voice icon, it will show **Starting**, then **Preparing**. 
* Only start speaking once it shows **Listening**. 
* When stopped, it will show **Processing** with a yellow bar.

### Auto-Stop & Limits
* If you do not speak for 7 seconds, the voice icon will automatically stop. 
* The maximum duration for a single recording is 5 minutes.

### Managing Downloads
* Check your internet connectivity before downloading a file. 
* Under **Available For Download**, you will find various voice models. Larger models provide higher accuracy but require more device memory and space. Smaller models are faster and use fewer resources but may be less accurate.
* During download, you will see **Loading** (downloading), **Pause**, and **Cancel** buttons. Pausing or losing internet will preserve your progress, allowing you to resume later from this page. Cancelling will delete the partial download.
* Once the voice model is downloaded, select the model you want from the **Installed Models** list. 
* **Important:** Even if only one model is installed, selecting the model is mandatory. The selected model will be shown in **bold** text, with a tick mark to its right.

### Compatibility & Errors
* A red warning icon indicates the model is incompatible with your device (usually due to RAM limits), but you can still attempt to download it. Clicking it will prompt a warning where you can choose to "Cancel" or "Download Anyway".

### Deleting Models
* To remove an installed model, swipe its name to the left and click the delete icon.
